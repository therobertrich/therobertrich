# Howdy there, Robert here!

I am Robert Richter. I am currently a full-time University student at Miami University in my senior year. I am pursuing a bachelors degree in Information Technology. I currently work in Accessibility. 

You probably won't find much useful here, I only code a bit, so this is where I store it. Most of everything is modified from tutorials on the internet or textbooks.
